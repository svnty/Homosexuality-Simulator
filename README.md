# Homosexuality-Simulator

## Abstract
Homosexuals have long assumed their sexual proclivities are biologically grounded. A previous GWAS identified 5 genes involved in homosexuality, 2 are gender-neutral, 2 are male associated and 1 is female associated, for a male to be homosexual he should have all 4 of the genes involved in the sexual preference, and for women all 3. A simulation was run which investigated the effect of breeding with these genes, all five genes were assumed to be recessive and to be a homosexual a male needed to be homozygous in all 4 genes, for example. The law of segregation was applied to all offspring with the calculated chance of their children inheriting genes from the parent's genes, homosexuals were given a chance to reproduce each generation of offspring. The data showed that homosexuals were extinct by generation 231. The simulation continued for 50 generations to check for a revival of the homosexual genes, no such case occurred.

## Introduction
A previous study by Ganna et al., identified that same-sex sexual behaviour is partly genetically influenced, this study identified that same-sex sexual behaviour is not influenced by one gene but several genes overlapping, one such gene is associated with personality trait openness to experience. A large data set (n=477,522) of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) was used to identify genes that have a statistical significance involved in same-sex sexual behaviour, a total of 5 genes were identified, 4 were significant in males and 3 in females, indicating that between the sexes there are genetic differences in same-sex sexual attraction. The gender non-specific SNPs were rs11114975-12q21.31 and rs10261857-7q31.2, in male-specific SNPs were rs28371400-15q21.3 and rs34730029-11q12.1 and in women the SNP was rs11114975. Each gene has a unique function and many roles involved in other functions of the body such as sensitivity to scents or male pattern balding, indicating that these genes are not isolated to sexual attraction. Also recorded in the research provided by Ganna et al., was the descriptive statistics of the prevalence of homosexuality as a sexual preference indicating that same-sex sexual behaviour is steadily increasing among populations, according to Darwinian natural selection genes are selected according to their fitness for survival and reproduction of a species, homosexuals not being able to pass on their genes reproductively would be negatively selected for a species survival. Proceeding with this information, a simulation was run to investigate the inheritance of homosexuality through a population, genetics would indicate to us that if a homosexual parent has a child there is a significant chance that the child would be a homosexual and continue homosexuality as a genotype.
